# Theory About Stats

In Stats; There Contain At Least 3 Attribute; Str, Dex, and Int.

However In 'Most' RPG's Stats It Contain At Least 4 Main Attribute; Str, Dex, Int, And Luck.

## Attribute

I Will Explain How The Attribute Work.

Note: This Is Just A Simple Frameworks. We Will Learn In Much Depth For Attribute In Later Session.

#### Str
```
Str Is A Short Form For Strength.
Str Can Be Deduce As 'Physical' Powers.
Str Can Affect Attack's Base.
Str Can Affect MaxHP.
Str Can Reduce Armour Weight.
```
You Can See That There Are Many Way Str Can Affect A User.

#### Dex
```
Dex is a short form for dextery.
dex can be use to increase the speed.
dex can effect how much damage per second u can made.
dex can increase the probabilty of how u can dodge attacks.
dex can increase craftmens productivity.
```

#### Calculation Base Damage
```
This Is My Own Calculation Theory.
Let Assume; The User Stats Is : LvL = 1, Str = 5;
Base Dmg is Not The Final Output.
Square Root = sqrt() || âˆš.
Base Dmg = sqrt(LvL) + ((Log(Str)+LvL)*2)
So The Output Is: 3.397940008672037609572522210551

More Than That;
let WA = Weapon Attack // this will be learn in next session
New Dmg = (Base Dmg + (sqrt(WA))/2) * (sqrt(LvL)/2)
So The New Output Is: 
```
So Why My Output Is Low?

That Because This Is Still Not The Last Damage Yet.
